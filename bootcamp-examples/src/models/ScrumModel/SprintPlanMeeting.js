                    In the first part of the Sprint Planning Meeting, the Product
                    Owner and Scrum Team (with facilitation from the Scrum
                    Master) review the Product Backlog, discussing the goals and
                    context for the items on the Backlog, and providing the Scrum
                    Team with insight into the Product Owner’s thinking.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    In the second part of the meeting, the Scrum Team selects the
                    items from the Product Backlog to commit to complete by the
                    end of the Sprint, starting at the top of the Product Backlog
                    (in others words, starting with the items that are the highest
                    priority for the Product Owner) and working down the list in
                    order.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    This is one of the key practices in Scrum: the team decides
                    how much work they will commit to complete, rather than
                    having it assigned to them by the Product Owner. This makes
                    for a much more reliable commitment.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    The Sprint Planning meeting will often last a number of
                    hours, the team is making a very serious commitment to complete
                    the work, and this commitment requires careful thought to be
                    successful.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    The team will begin by estimating how much time each
                    member has for Sprint-related work – in other words, their
                    average workday minus the time they spend doing things like
                    critical bug-fixes and other maintenance, attending meetings,
                    doing email, taking lunch breaks, and so on. For most people
                    this works out to 4-6 hours of time per day available for
                    Sprint-related work.
