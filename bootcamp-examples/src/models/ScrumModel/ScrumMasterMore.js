                            Mostly in a team scrum master is a person who have some expertise

                            The Scrum Master is not the manager of the team; he or she
                            serves the team, by helping remove blocks to the team’s
                            success, facilitating meetings, and supporting the practice of
                            Scrum.

                            Some teams will have someone dedicated fully to the role of
                            Scrum Master, while others will have a team member play this
                            role (carrying a lighter load of regular work when they do so).

                            Great Scrum Masters have come from all backgrounds and
                            disciplines: Project Management, Engineering, Design,
                            Testing.

                            The Scrum Master and the Product Owner probably shouldn’t
                            be the same individual; at times, the Scrum Master may be
                            called upon to push back on the Product Owner (for example,
                            if they try to introduce new requirements in the middle of a Sprint).
