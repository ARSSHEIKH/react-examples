                Following the Sprint Review, the team gets together for the Sprint
                Retrospective.

                    <li>
                        It’s an opportunity for the team to discuss what’s working and what’s not
                        working, and agree on changes to try. The Scrum Team, the Product
                        Owner, and the ScrumMaster will all attend, and a neutral outsider will
                        facilitate the meeting; a good approach is for Scrum Masters to facilitate
                        each others’ retrospectives, which enables crosspollination among teams. This is a practice that some teams skip, and that’s unfortunate because it’s one of
                        the most important tools for making Scrum successful
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
