                        Team Members build the product that the customer is going to
                        consume: the software, the website, or whatever it may be.

                        The team in Scrum is typically five to ten people, although
                        teams as large as 15 and as small as 3 commonly report benefits.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The team should include all the expertise necessary to deliver
                        the finished work â€“ so, for example, the team for a software
                        project might include roles ( programmers, interface
                        designers, testers, marketers, and researchers).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
        </div>
    )
