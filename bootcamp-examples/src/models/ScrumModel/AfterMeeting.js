                    signed up for on the Sprint Backlog.

                    The important thing is that it show the team their actual
                    progress towards their goal – and not in terms of how much
                    time has been spent so far (an irrelevant fact, as far as Scrum
                    is concerned), but in terms of how much work remains – what
                    separates the team from their goal.

                    If the curve is not tracking towards completion at the end of
                    the Sprint, then the team needs to either pick up the pace, or
                    simplify and cut down what it’s doing.
