                    The Scrum Master makes note of the blocks, and then helps
                    team members to resolve them after the meeting.

                    The Product Owner, Managers, and other stakeholders can
                    attend the meeting, but they should refrain from asking
                    questions or opening discussion until after the meeting
                    concludes.

                    Everyone should be clear that the team is reporting to each
                    other, not to the Product Owner, Managers or Scrum Master. While itâ€™s non-standard, some teams find it useful to have the
                    Product Owners join and give a brief daily report of their own
                    activities to the team.
