                    Following the Sprint Review Meeting, the Product Owner
                    takes all the input, as well as all new priorities that have
                    appeared during the Sprint, and incorporates them into the
                    Product Backlog; new items are added, and existing ones are
                    modified, reordered, or deleted.
                </li><br/>
                <li>
                    Once this updating of the Product Backlog is complete, the
                    cycle is ready to begin all over again, with the next Sprint
                    Planning Meeting.

                <li>
                    One practice many teams find useful is to hold a Prioritization
                    Meeting toward the end of each Sprint, to review the Product
                    Backlog for the upcoming Sprint with the Product Owner.
                </li><br/>
                <li>
                    In addition to giving the team an opportunity to suggest items
                    the Product Owner may not be aware of – technical
                    maintenance, for example – this meeting also kicks off any
                    preliminary thinking that’s required before the Sprint Planning
                    Meeting.
                </li><br/>
                <li>
                    There’s no downtime between Sprints – teams will often go
                    from a Sprint Review one afternoon into the next Sprint
                    Planning Meeting the following morning.
                </li><br/>

                    One of the values of Agile development is “sustainable pace”, 
                    and only by working regular hours at a reasonable level of
                    intensity can teams continue this cycle indefinitely
