                    One of the key pillars of Scrum is that once the Scrum Team
                    makes its commitment, the Product Owner cannot add new
                    requests during the course of the Sprint. This means that even
                    if halfway through the Sprint the Product Owner decides that
                    they want to add something new, he or she cannot make
                    changes until the start of the next Sprint     </li><br/>
                <li>
                    If an external circumstance appears that significantly changes
                    priorities, and means the team would be wasting its time if it
                    continued working, the Product Owner can terminate the
                    Sprint; this means the team stops all the work they are doing,
                    and starts over with a Sprint Planning meeting, and so forth.
