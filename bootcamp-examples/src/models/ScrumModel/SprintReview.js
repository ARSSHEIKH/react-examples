                    After the Sprint ends, there is the Sprint Review, where the
                    team demos what they’ve built during the Sprint.

                <li>
                    Present at this meeting are the Product Owner, Team
                    Members, and ScrumMaster, plus customers, stakeholders,
                    experts, executives, and anyone else interested. This is not a
                    “presentation” the team gives – there are no PowerPoints, and
                    typically no more than 30 minutes is spent preparing for it –
                    it’s literally just a demo of what’s been built, and anyone
                    present is free to ask questions and give input. It can last 10
                    minutes, or it can last two hours – whatever it takes to show
                    what’s been built and get feedback.
