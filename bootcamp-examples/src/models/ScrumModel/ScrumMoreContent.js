                    Scrum is an iterative, incremental process. It is use to manage the complex software development and it is 
                    usually consists on the team of 3 to 9 persons.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Scrum uses iteration manner of development.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As scrum belongs to agile so it provide frequent deleveries.

                        <li>
                            Some basic point of attraction in scrum are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    It is lightweight framework.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            It is not like that if you adopt it, so you expend all of your time on it, No it says just adopt me and do continue your work.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    It urge you to work in the form of a team.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    It is self organizing type of framework
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                            Scrum structures product development in cycles of work called Sprints,
                            iterations of work which are typically 1-4 weeks in length.
                            <ul>
                                
                                <li>
                                    The Sprints are of fixed duration – they end on a specific date
                                    whether the work has been completed or not, and are never
                                    extended.
                                </li>
                                
                                <li>
                                    At the beginning of each Sprint, a cross-functional team
                                    selects items from a prioritized list of requirements, and
                                    commits to complete them by the end of the Sprint.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Each work day, the team gathers briefly to report to each
                                    other on progress, and update simple visual representations of
                                    work remaining.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    At the end of the Sprint, the team demonstrates what they
                                    have built, and gets feedback which can then be acted upon in
                                    the next Sprint.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Scrum emphasizes producing working product that at the end
                                    of the Sprint is really “done”; in the case of software, this
                                    means code that is fully tested and potentially shippable.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
